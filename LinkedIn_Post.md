🚀 **Excited to share SwiftRide - A Full-Stack, Dockerized Ride Sharing Platform!**

I've built a comprehensive ride-sharing application demonstrating enterprise-level design patterns and clean architecture.

---

## 🏗️ **Backend Architecture (Spring Boot 3.3.5 + Java 17):**

**Design Patterns Implemented:**

🎨 **Decorator Pattern** - Dynamic fare calculation with stackable features (Premium +$25, Child Seat +$15)

💳 **Strategy Pattern** - Flexible payment processing (Cash, Credit Card, Wallet)

🏭 **Factory Pattern** - Smart payment method selection with dependency injection

📦 **Repository Pattern** - Clean data access layer with JPA

🔄 **DTO Pattern** - Secure API data transfer with custom mappers

⚙️ **Service Layer Pattern** - Separated business logic with transactional management

---

## 🚀 **Key Features:**

✅ Multi-role system (Customer, Driver, Employee)
✅ Complete trip lifecycle management
✅ Multiple payment methods with dynamic pricing
✅ Email notifications (Spring Mail)
✅ Async processing (RabbitMQ)
✅ Role-based security (Spring Security)
✅ Profile photo upload
✅ Complaint management system
✅ **Fully Dockerized Environment** 🐳

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**

**Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Spring Security, Docker, Maven

**Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Dark Mode - *crafted with Antigravity AI*

---

## 💡 **Key Learnings:**

- Clean Architecture & SOLID principles
- Real-world design pattern implementation
- Asynchronous message processing
- RESTful API design
- Database design & JPA relationships
